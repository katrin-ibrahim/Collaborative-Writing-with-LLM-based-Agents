# History

Kenkoku University, which translates to "National Foundation University," reflects a deeper historical context intertwined with Japan's cultural and national identity. The university’s inception and development are intrinsically tied to significant events in Japanese history, particularly those centered around the concept of nation-building and modernization. While Kenkoku University itself is not directly mentioned in the collected information, its name evokes themes central to understanding the history of Japan.
The establishment of National Foundation Day (建国記念の日, Kenkoku Kinen no Hi) on February 11th annually serves as a pivotal point for examining Japanese historical consciousness [3]. This holiday, observed since 1967, commemorates the accession date of Emperor Jimmu, traditionally considered Japan's first emperor. The choice to establish this day reflects broader efforts to reframe and reinforce national identity after World War II, emphasizing continuity with an ancient imperial lineage.
Historically, Japan has been influenced by various international interactions that have shaped its cultural and political landscape over centuries. For example, the Meiji Restoration (1868) marked a period of rapid modernization following two centuries of isolation [1]. This transformative era set the stage for subsequent industrial growth and militaristic expansion in East Asia, including the colonization of Korea from 1910 to 1945.
The university's name also resonates with historical efforts to establish educational institutions that support broader national goals. Historically, universities have played a crucial role in developing intellectual leadership and fostering innovation, both essential for nation-building [4]. Given this context, Kenkoku University may have been established as part of a larger effort to build human capital that could contribute effectively to Japan's socio-economic development post-World War II.

# Administration

Kenkoku University, founded in 1948 under the name Keonguk Industrial School and later becoming an integral part of the Baekdu Association educational system, has a rich history deeply rooted in the community it serves. The institution initially started as a specialized school for industrial training and higher education for girls, reflecting its foundational goal to provide focused educational opportunities [5].
Over time, the administration of Kenkoku University evolved into a structure that supports a wide range of academic programs from kindergarten through high school levels. The administrative framework is designed to ensure the institution's mission aligns with both local community needs and broader educational goals set by Osaka Prefecture, under which it operates as an Article 1 private school [5].
The governance model at Kenkoku University emphasizes the importance of specialization within academia. This means that academic departments are structured to provide focused expertise in specific fields, allowing educators and students to delve deeply into specialized subjects—a practice that is seen as crucial for developing objective truth through methodological rigor and studious effort [6]. The administration's commitment to such a model reflects a broader trend towards recognizing the value of specialization as an effective information-management strategy within educational institutions.
Additionally, like many modern academic institutions, Kenkoku University likely faces ongoing challenges related to balancing traditional educational values with contemporary demands for diversity and inclusivity in its curriculum and student body. These considerations are integral to the administrative decisions that shape policies on recruitment, curriculum design, and community engagement [6].

# Campus Life

The university strives to provide students with diverse opportunities for engagement through clubs, organizations, cultural events, and athletic activities. These outlets not only enrich the student experience but also foster a sense of community among students from various backgrounds.
The academic environment at Kenkoku University emphasizes specialization within different fields, encouraging students to delve deeply into their areas of interest [6]. This approach is reflected in the range of majors and minors available across its departments, as well as through collaborative projects that allow interdisciplinary learning. The university’s commitment to rigorous academic standards reflects a belief in methodological rigor and studious effort as preconditions for objective truth.
Beyond academics, Kenkoku University values its students' holistic development. Cultural events hosted throughout the year celebrate diversity and promote intercultural understanding among the student body [4].

These experiences are integral to preparing students for a globalized workforce and fostering cross-cultural competencies.

# Research

Kenkoku University is recognized for its active engagement in various research fields, contributing significantly to academic knowledge and practical applications across disciplines [4]. While specific details about the university's particular areas of focus may vary, typical research activities within a higher education institution such as Kenkoku might include historical studies, social sciences, natural sciences, and interdisciplinary projects. Given that history is a broad discipline encompassing many branches including political, military, social, and economic histories [4], it is likely that researchers at Kenkoku University engage in detailed historiographical work and methodological approaches to understand past events.
The university's commitment to research might also extend into specialized areas such as academic specialization or the development of double major programs, allowing for more diverse exposure to various fields of study [6]. Such specializations enable educators and researchers at Kenkoku University to contribute to their respective disciplines with a high degree of methodological rigor and expertise.
Moreover, as part of its research mission, Kenkoku University may collaborate with international organizations like the United Nations specialized agencies that work in areas related to education, culture, and social issues [7].

# Admissions and Enrollment

Kenkoku Daigaku, also referred to as Kendai, was established in Hsinking (modern Changchun), Jilin province, during the period when Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state, occupied Manchuria. The university operated from May 1938 until August 7, 1945, with its primary function being to support the educational objectives of Japan under their governance in the region [2].
Given that Kendai was an institution within a regime established by a foreign occupying power, admissions and enrollment processes were heavily influenced by the political context of Manchukuo. The institution would have likely prioritized students aligned with or sympathetic to the goals and ideologies propagated by the Japanese regime. However, specific details regarding admission requirements, application procedures, or student demographics are not well-documented in historical records.
The university's brief tenure means that its admissions policies might have evolved during this period as Manchukuo sought to legitimize itself through cultural and educational institutions. Nevertheless, due to the political nature of its establishment, it can be assumed that Kendai’s enrollment process was tailored to support the broader aims of Japanese influence and control in occupied territories [2].
